## Exerience with GIT
* I have intermediate experience working with GIT. 
* All most all the project i have worked on so far we have used GIT for the version control. I used Source tree, GITLab, GIThub and familiar with few basic GIT commands like pull, push and commit, creating new branches and merging the branches by resolving the merge conflicts.
* The above meme reminded me the incident when we pushed our new changes in the GIT and deployed them and after testing we realized that we pushed new bugs with it. So, as we don't have time to fix the bugs we just reverted back our changes and again deployed the old changes. 

## Sharing Info
- I would like to share links of my public STA 631 repo to communicate about my work progress of my Week 1.

## Portfolio

- I personally liked the Garrick Aden-Buie profile as it was subtle and simple with a flexible UI that any user can find what they are looking for. <https://www.garrickadenbuie.com>
