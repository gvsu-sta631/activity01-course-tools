## Introduction
* Hai, this is _Dharani Vulpala_
* This is my first activity: **Activity-1**
* The image below is the replication of my present state of mind indicating to be calm as am totally nervous using the github for the first time.

* I did select this image because I feel bit nervous when it comes to statistics.
* So far, with the assurance given by the Professor, I wish I should successfully get trained with github and explore more options to use it in an effective way.
* I would prefer microsoft teams to share the information that I have learnt during Week-1.

## Portfolio
I did explore few websites and potfolios but the portfolio of Thomas who's a contenet manager really attracted me.
- The link for the portfolio is <https://thomasbosc.com/en.html>
- I did like the way he expressed himself about his projects, content and hobbies were very professional.
